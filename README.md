This exercise was designed based on the [Javascript Learning Module of MDN Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting). 

Please bare in mind the focus was not design - the focus here was simply focusing on the Javascript approach and understand how I can select and manipulate elements.
